A project analyzing 9,700 property datasets to predict housing prices. Achieved 99% accuracy in data cleaning and preprocessing, identified 14 key factors affecting prices, and applied Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Linear Regression models with 82% predictive accuracy. Geospatial analysis revealed that high-value homes are near the ocean and city center. The project utilized Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to create visualizations and reports for stakeholders.
